When the user selects the None option, the selected book disappears from all the shelves.

On the initial screen, the initial state of the Shelf can be seen.

When the user presses the button with the + symbol, he is sent to the search page which has a box with the message "Search by Subject". 
In this box the user can search for books, using the key words shown on the screen.

The system recognizes the initial letter of each keyword and begins to show results when the initial letter is typed.

The system is configured to give 20 search results each time a search is performed.

Each book on this search page is equipped with a button, which when pressed shows the current status of the book, i.e. the shelf it is on.  
From this screen you can add books to the shelf page.

The backend server contains the necessary methods to perform operations on the backend.

METHODS:

#getAll.
#update.

<strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong>

1. Clone de respository folder.

2. Unzip the repository folder with the option "Extract here" in the directory of your choice.  (Unzip with the option "Extract here" will prevent the creation of a double directory that prevents the application from launching when using the runtime environment Node.js.

3. Inside of the unziped directory with the repository, you will find two ziped folders called public.rar and src.rar.  Unzip the both directories with the option "Extract here".

4. Open cmd and navigate using the command cd to the directory with the repository.
